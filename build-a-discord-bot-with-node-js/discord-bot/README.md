# How to Build a Discord Bot with Node.js

Here is the source code for the tutorial! 

We will set up a Discord Bot using Node.js and npm (node package manager):

* Node: https://nodejs.org/en/

* npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/latest-version

## Dependencies

Running `npm install discord.js dotenv` will install the two dependencies needed for this project.

## **env** File

An **.env** file exists in this project to hold our bot's secret token.

We can run `code .env` in the project directory, via our terminal, to open/edit this file.


Happy bot making!
