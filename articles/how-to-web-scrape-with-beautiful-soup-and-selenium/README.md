## What is Docs?

[Codecademy Docs](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs) is intended to be a free, easily accessible reference for coding terms and concepts available to learners all over the world. If you forget what JavaScript hoisting is, we want you to be able to look up "JS hoisting" on any search engine, click a Codecademy Doc entry, and have an answer in seconds.

## What stage of development are we in right now?

Docs is live with about 590 high-quality entries. Now that the MVP is out, our goal is to transition some ownership of Docs content to the Codecademy community, since maintaining a resource of this type at-scale is only possible if it's open-source. That means we need your help, whether it's contributing, reviewing, or evangelizing!

## Core Team

TBD

We are building a team of community volunteers to maintain Codecademy Docs. Let us know if you are interested.

## What do I need to do before contributing? 

Before contributing, please read through the [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/Codecademy/docs/tree/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). There you'll find a write-up of our standards for content and style, as well as templates for creating your entries.

## How do I contribute?

Contributing is as simple as:

1. Forking this repo.
2. Editing your fork.
    - Be sure to fetch the main branch shortly before you make your editsâ€”this repo is constantly changing, and trying to merge too old of a fork can be a challenge!
4. Making a pull request to merge your fork with this repo.

If you haven't gone through this workflow before, you can check out [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgbCcBNZcdQ) to learn about how to make a pull request from a fork using Git. Alternatively, if you'd prefer to keep things to the GitHub UI for now, you can follow the instructions in that video up to 1:18 to fork this repo. After that, you can create your entry in your fork using the UI and then make a pull request by pressing this handy button:<br>

If you are uncomfortable using Git, you can also check out [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/RPagOAUx2SQ) to do this all using the GitHub Desktop app.
